# unity-mono

Unity3D distribution of Mono

This can be useful to build code that must run inside a Unity3D game.
The rationale is that binary distributions of older Mono versions are not so easy to install, and often must be rebuilt from source.

This package has been taken from the experimental Linux Unity package (version 5.1.0f3+2015090301), and is here for pure convenience (so one does not need to download and install the whole Unity package if the build environment only needs Mono).

Source code for this package should be at https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/mono (because the package has been built by Unity).
